NcLPMO9C
(C4-oxidizing cellulose, cello-oligosaccharides, xyloglucan)	AA9-CBM1 (WT)
AA9	Kd measured for phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) and xyloglucan showed weaker binding for CBM truncated NcLPMO9C. 
No CBM truncation effect on activity comparison for PASC but a 2-fold reduction in catalytic rate against xyloglucan. 

Truncation of the CBM reduced the binding affinity and activity but did not affect regioselectivity.
The linker is important for the thermal stability.	Borisova et al 2015 (41)

AA10-CBM10	Study on deleting and replacing CBMs in two cellulose-oxidizing LPMOs. 
Introducing other types of cellulose binding CBMs both potentiated and inhibited the LPMO activity. Such effects were both enzyme and substrate specific.
Changed ratio between native and oxidized products when replacing the CBM2 to a CBM10 – CBMs can modulate the mode of action of LPMOs.	Crouch et al 2016 (27)

AA10-CBM5	Removal of both CBMs reduced LPMO activity toward α-chitin compared with the full-length enzyme, but in synergistic reactions with an endo-chitinase equal levels of solubilized products were observed. 

Structural analysis of two similar chitin-binding CBMs with different affinity for crystalline chitin and soluble chitohexaose. The effect of CBMs on chitin oxidation is substrate concentration dependent; at low concentrations, the CBM-containing variants performed better, whereas at high concentrations the differences were less apparent.

AA9 (including three mutated variants; Y24A, Y211A & Y24A_Y211A) 
	Removal of the CBM, post-translationally by papain hydrolysis, led to a truncated variant with 21 remaining residues of the predicted linker which exhibited reduced binding and activity towards cellulose compared to the full-length enzyme. The X-ray structure revealed that the glycosylated linker forms an integral part covering a hydrophobic patch on the catalytic LPMO domain. 

Removing the CBM resulted in reduced binding but did not alter the regioselectivity. However, the effects of point mutations in the catalytic domain became more apparent in the absence of the CBM.	Hansson et al 2017 (51)

AA10-FnIII-FnIII	The enzyme functionality was strongly dependent on the CBM that is responsible for substrate binding and protects the enzyme from inactivation. Truncation of one or two of the FnIIIs (both in combination with the CBM) resulted in essentially the same effect as when only the CBM was removed.	Mutahir et al 2018 (31)

PaLPMO9H
(C1/C4-oxidizing cellulose, cello-oligosaccharides, xyloglucan)	AA9-CBM1 (WT)
AA9	CBM truncation weakened the binding and affected the catalytic performance on nanofibrils, amorphous and crystalline cellulosic substrates, although the isolated catalytic domain retained activity on cellohexaose. 
Increasing the substrate concentration reduces the need for a CBM. 
The truncated variant showed a modified regioselectivity with increased C1-oxidation.
Optical and atomic force microscopy of the insoluble fraction revealed that both variants can promote disruption of the cellulose network and the CBM is not essential.	Chalak et al 2019 (32)
