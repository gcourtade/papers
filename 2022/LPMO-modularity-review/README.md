·         Reduced cellulose activity of CBM truncated enzyme.

·          

·         NMR spectroscopy study showing structural and dynamic features of a modular LPMO.

·         The substrate-binding affinity resides with the CBM.

·         Comparison of the catalytic performance of full-length and truncated LPMO revealed that the CBM is beneficial for LPMO activity at lower substrate concentrations and promotes localized and repeated oxidation of the substrate.

·          

Truncation of the CBM leads to elevated H2O2 production and decreased enzyme stability (both in absence and presence of cellulose).

Release of copper by damaged enzymes promote H2O2 production, which increased LPMO catalytic rate followed by inactivation.

Observed synergistic effects when combining the two enzyme forms, that are due to a combination of high oxidase activity (i.e., increased LPMO-dependent H2O2 production) [\[GC1\]](https://studntnu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/courtade_ntnu_no/Documents/Minireview_modularity_LPMOs/Mini%20review_V6.docx#_msocom_1) by the truncated enzyme and efficient productive use of H2O2 (i.e., peroxygenase activity) [\[GC2\]](https://studntnu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/courtade_ntnu_no/Documents/Minireview_modularity_LPMOs/Mini%20review_V6.docx#_msocom_2) by the full-length enzyme. | Forsberg _et al_ 2014 (36)

No CBM truncation effect on activity comparison for PASC but a 2-fold reduction in catalytic rate against xyloglucan.

Truncation of the CBM reduced the binding affinity and activity but did not affect regioselectivity.

The linker is important for the thermal stability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Borisova _et al_ 2015 (41)

Structural analysis of two similar chitin-binding CBMs with different affinity for crystalline chitin and soluble chitohexaose. The effect of CBMs on chitin oxidation is substrate concentration dependent; at low concentrations, the CBM-containing variants performed better, whereas at high concentrations the differences were less apparent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Forsberg _et al_ 2016 (29)

AA9-<sup>21 amino acid linker fragment</sup>

AA9 _(including three mutated variants; Y24A, Y211A & Y24A\_Y211A)_                | Removal of the CBM, post-translationally by papain hydrolysis, led to a truncated variant with 21 remaining residues of the predicted linker which exhibited reduced binding and activity towards cellulose compared to the full-length enzyme. The X-ray structure revealed that the glycosylated linker forms an integral part covering a hydrophobic patch on the catalytic LPMO domain.

Removing the CBM resulted in reduced binding but did not alter the regioselectivity. However, the effects of point mutations in the catalytic domain became more apparent in the absence of the CBM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Hansson _et al_ 2017 (51)

Increasing the substrate concentration reduces the need for a CBM.

The truncated variant showed a modified regioselectivity with increased C1-oxidation.

Optical and atomic force microscopy of the insoluble fraction revealed that both variants can promote disruption of the cellulose network and the CBM is not essential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Chalak _et al_ 2019 (32)                                                                                      |
